[...] Because she made not one but two of the decade's greatest singles, with Crazy in Love and Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It), not to mention her hits with Destiny's Child; and this was the decade when singles – particularly R&B singles – regained their status as pop's favourite medium. [...] [She] and not any superannuated rock star was arguably the greatest live performer of the past 10 years.\" In 2013, Beyoncé made the Time 100 list, Baz Luhrmann writing \"no one has that voice, no one moves the way she moves, no one can hold an audience the way she does... When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA — the reigning national voice.\" In 2014, Beyoncé was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured on the cover of the issue.\n",

        "\n",
        "Based on the qualitative evaluation using selected examples from the SQuAD v2 validation set, the RAG pipeline demonstrates mixed performance, primarily hindered by the effectiveness of the semantic retriever.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Observations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Retriever Limitations:** The semantic retriever, using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` Sentence Transformer model and FAISS indexing, did not consistently retrieve the most relevant context passages for the test questions. For instance:\n",
        "    *   For the question \"Who ruled the duchy of Normandy?\", the retrieved contexts were related to the Capetian dynasty and the Low Countries instead of the specific Norman rulers like Richard I.\n",
        "    *   For the question \"When was the French version of the word Norman first recorded?\", the retrieved contexts discussed English word origins and 9th-century treaties, failing to provide information about the French term's recording date.\n",
        "*   **Impact on LLM:** The question-answering model (`distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`), while capable of extracting answers from provided text, is heavily reliant on the quality and relevance of the context it receives from the retriever. When the retrieved context is irrelevant, the LLM either produces incorrect answers or attempts to answer questions that have no answer within the provided (irrelevant) text.\n",
        "*   **Handling of No-Answer Questions:** For questions in the SQuAD v2 validation set that are designed to have no answer in the original context, the pipeline, due to the irrelevant retrieved contexts, still often generated an answer based on the spurious information in the retrieved passages. This indicates a limitation in handling unanswerable questions effectively in the current setup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations of the Current Pipeline:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Semantic Retriever Accuracy:** The primary bottleneck is the retriever's ability to fetch highly relevant documents based on the query.\n",
        "2.  **Dependency on Context Quality:** The performance of the question-answering model is directly constrained by the relevance of the context provided by the retriever.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Potential Areas for Improvement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "To enhance the performance of this RAG pipeline, consider exploring the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Alternative Embedding Models:** Experiment with different or fine-tuned Sentence Transformer models that might generate better embeddings for the SQuAD dataset.\n",
        "*   **FAISS Index Optimization:** Investigate different FAISS index types, parameters, or data preprocessing techniques to improve retrieval accuracy.\n",
        "*   **Re-ranking Mechanism:** Implement a re-ranking step using a more powerful model (e.g., a cross-encoder) to re-score and reorder the initially retrieved contexts, prioritizing the most relevant ones.\n",
        "*   **No-Answer Handling:** Develop strategies or utilize question-answering models specifically designed to handle questions where no answer is present in the context, potentially by predicting a confidence score or an \"is\\_impossible\" flag."

        "The first bar chart shows the counts of \"Correct Answers\", \"No-Answer Handled Well\", and \"Incorrect Answers\" for each combination. A higher \"Correct Answers\" and \"No-Answer Handled Well\" count, and a lower \"Incorrect Answers\" count indicate better performance.\n",

        "**Interpretation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   From both charts, it is evident that all tested model combinations struggled significantly with the selected test questions. The number of incorrect answers is consistently higher than the number of correct answers or instances where no-answer questions were handled well.\n",
        "*   This reinforces the earlier observation that the primary challenge lies in the **retrieval phase**. If the retriever does not provide relevant context, the question-answering model cannot generate accurate answers, regardless of its own capabilities.\n",
        "*   The difference in performance between the tested Sentence Transformer models (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and `multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`) and the Question Answering models (`distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad` and `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad`) is not substantial on this specific set of challenging questions. All combinations exhibit similar patterns of failure due to poor context retrieval.\n",
        "*   The simple scoring metric suggests that the combinations using the `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad` QA model performed slightly better (less negatively) than those using the `bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad` model, but the overall performance remains poor across the board.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion from Visualization:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The visualization clearly highlights that improving the semantic retriever's ability to fetch relevant contexts is the most crucial step for improving this RAG pipeline's performance on the SQuAD v2 dataset. Without accurate context, even a powerful question-answering model will struggle to provide correct answers."

Some 82,000 people are thought to have immigrated to the state from 2000–2005 mainly coming from Veracruz (17.6%), United States (16.2%), Durango (13.2%), Coahuila (8.0%) and Chiapas (4.5%). It is believed that there is a large number of undocumented immigrants in that state the come from Central and South America which mainly settle in Ciudad Juárez. According to the 2005 census, the population grew 1.06% from 2000 to 2005. The state has an uneven settlement of people and the lowest population density of any Mexican state; according to the 2005 census there were 12 people per km2. Of all the 3,241,444 people in the state, two-thirds (2,072,129) live in the cities of Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua.

            "- The primary weakness across all combinations is the semantic retriever's accuracy.\n",
            "  Even with different retriever models, the retrieved contexts are often not the most relevant to the question, especially for questions with no direct short answer in the dataset.\n",
            "  Example: For 'Who ruled the duchy of Normandy?', the retriever often returns general historical context rather than specific rulers.\n",
            "- The QA model's performance is highly dependent on the quality of the retrieved context.\n",
            "  When the context is irrelevant, both QA models ('distilbert' and 'bert-large') tend to produce incorrect or nonsensical answers.\n",
            "  Example: For 'What treaty was established in the 9th century?' (a no-answer question), irrelevant contexts lead to incorrect generated answers.\n",
            "- The 'bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad' QA model seems slightly better at extracting answers when the context is somewhat relevant, but it also struggles significantly with irrelevant contexts.\n",
            "- Neither pipeline combination effectively handles questions with no answer in the dataset when irrelevant context is provided. They still attempt to generate an answer.\n",
            "- The difference between the two retriever models ('all-MiniLM-L6-v2' and 'multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1') on this small set of questions does not show a clear winner, suggesting retriever improvement is a critical area.\n",
            "\n",
            "Strengths:\n",
            "- When the retriever *does* provide a highly relevant context, both QA models are generally capable of extracting the correct answer.\n",
            "  (Note: This was not clearly demonstrated by the chosen negative examples, but is a known capability of these QA models on relevant text).\n"

            "The most prevalent categories are 'Incorrect' and 'Incorrect (generated answer for a no-answer question)'.\n",

            "The bar chart clearly illustrates the dominance of the 'Incorrect' and 'Incorrect (generated answer for a no-answer question)' categories.\n",

            "Conclusion:\n",
            "The qualitative evaluation and visualization highlight that the current RAG pipeline, using the selected default models and retrieval strategy, is not effectively answering questions from the SQuAD v2 dataset.\n",
